Cross your fingers. That's, like, a basic rule for this sort of thing.

The folder data/xenomailab/ should be copied to ~/.xenomailab/
This is where the blocks are stored.
Remember to build a project before executing it because there are no executables untill you build them :-)

make

2.Prepare workspace
